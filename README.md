Inference of Large Multimodal Models in C/C++

##Warning
This is still work in progress and not ready for anything.

## Description
This repo implements LLaVA inference in C/C++ on top of 
[clip.cpp](https://github.com/monatis/clip.cpp)
and [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp).
Eventually, it will support inference of other large multimodal models, but LLaVA is chosen as a starting point.
